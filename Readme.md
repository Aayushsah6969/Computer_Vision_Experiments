# 🧠 Computer Vision Experiments Repository

Welcome to my **Computer Vision (CV) Experiments** repository.  
This repo will contain all of my small projects, studies, and practical exercises as I learn and explore the field of Computer Vision. Each folder will represent a separate experiment or topic — from basic image manipulation to advanced vision algorithms.

## 🌟 Why Computer Vision Matters

Computer Vision is one of the fastest-growing areas in AI, enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world.  
It allows computers to:

- Detect objects  
- Recognize faces  
- Understand scenes  
- Track movement  
- Make intelligent decisions based on images or videos  

It bridges the gap between **digital systems** and the **physical world**, making it foundational in countless applications we rely on every day.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

2. Per-experiment setup (typically):

- Create a Python virtual environment (e.g., `python -m venv .venv`)
- Install packages from `requirements.txt` (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Run the experiment script (for example: `python main.py` inside an experiment folder)

3. Explore experiments in order or jump to topics that interest you.

## 📚 How Computer Vision Is Implemented

Computer Vision techniques are commonly grouped into three categories:

### 1. Classical Image Processing

- Canny edge detection
- Sobel filters
- Thresholding and histograms
- Morphological operations (erosion, dilation)
- Contours and Hough transforms

### 2. Traditional Machine Learning

- SVMs, k-NN, Random Forests
- Feature descriptors: SIFT, SURF, ORB

### 3. Deep Learning / Modern CV

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Object detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN)
- Semantic segmentation (U-Net, DeepLab)
- Vision Transformers (ViT)

These approaches are complementary: classical methods are lightweight and interpretable, while deep learning provides state-of-the-art performance for many tasks.
